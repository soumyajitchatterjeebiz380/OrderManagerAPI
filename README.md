## Introduction
The OrderManagementAPI is a tool designed to manage orders within your application. It achieves this by facilitating interactions with another external API, seamlessly integrating order-related operations into your software ecosystem.

## About
This project is a simulation of some industry-standard technologies that provide optimal application performance and scalability. By implementing asynchronous code, I ensure swift and responsive handling of API requests, enhancing the user experience while efficiently utilizing system resources. I have also integrated service discovery via Eureka, allowing seamless communication between services and dynamic automated registration. Furthermore, I created a simple API gateway that centralizes and manages external service communication, which is integrated with the Eureka service to help provide future security management and seamless API redirection.
## Features
List the key features of your project here. You can use bullet points or a numbered list for clarity.

- **Asynchronous Code**: My project efficiently handles API requests with asynchronous code execution, ensuring swift responses and optimal resource utilization.

- **Service Discovery with Eureka**: I've integrated Netflix Eureka for automated service registration, load balancing, and fault tolerance, enabling seamless service communication.

- **API Gateway**: My system centralizes and manages external service communication through an API gateway, offering routing,  and in the future, load balancing, security enforcement, and analytics for enhanced reliability and performance.
